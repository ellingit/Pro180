Checkmate...
check board configurations
overload board constructor? (GM constructor?) to take in a board config


effects of moving a piece
everything in the moved piece's path
available moves of any piece that could have used the destination(on or through)
available moves of any piece that can now use the origin

before moving a piece, make a list of affected pieces or locations
could cut down processing time for AI
could simplify check/checkmate checking

--

AI can focus on opening strategies
- opponent AI's will be making less critical decisions near the beginning of the game
- store a bank of opening moves made by chessmasters
	- especially against computers (where the human won)
- favor stalemate over loss
	- how would enemy ai be detecting stalemate? any way to turn that against it?
